# ExposureIQ — SHV Group Vulnerability Intelligence (POC)

> **Use case:** Lack of centralised visibility for cross-group vulnerability information (Rapid7 & Microsoft Defender for Endpoint).
> **Positioning:** Rapid7 stays a *source* · Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) becomes the *exposure-management layer* · Power BI is the *reporting layer* · GenAI adds *insight* on top.

All data is **simulated** by the backend. It is generated deterministically, so every run shows the same numbers, and every screen reconciles with every other screen.

## Run it

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
cd exposureiq-poc/backend
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:4100
```

```bash
cd exposureiq-poc/frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5180  (proxies /api → :4100)
```

Open http://localhost:5180.

## What's inside

| Screen | Who it's for | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Command Center** | Group CISO / leadership | AI executive briefing, enterprise exposure score gauge, KPIs (P1/P2, KEV, SLA, MTTR, MTTI, coverage), 13-week trend, company scorecard, "fix these first", the correlation dividend |
| **Ask ExposureIQ** | Everyone | GenAI copilot (simulated): board summaries, patch plans, KEV exposure, SLA breaches, company deep dives, CVE explanations. Answers include tables, cited sources and follow-up questions |
| **Vulnerabilities** | Security analysts | One de-duplicated, risk-ranked list across both tools. Filters, CSV export and a detail drawer with the score breakdown, a "two tools, one truth" comparison, AI remediation guidance and ServiceNow ticket creation |
| **Assets & Coverage** | Analysts, infra leads | Unified inventory, scanner coverage donut, "who sees what" by asset type, blind spots found by Defender device discovery |
| **Remediation & SLA** | BU IT leads | SHV unified SLA policy, company × priority compliance heatmap, MTTR vs target, backlog ageing, inflow vs outflow, overdue work, team accountability |
| **Correlation Engine** | Analysts, auditors | Sankey of 2 raw feeds → unified findings, overlap Venn, MTTI by source, severity disagreements resolved, asset-match review queue |
| **Data Sources** | Platform team | Animated data pipeline, connector health, sync now, field mappings (MDVM, MDE, Rapid7, CMDB, KEV/EPSS, Power BI, Azure OpenAI) |
| **Reports** | Leadership, audit | Weekly ops, monthly executive and audit evidence packs. Printable (Save as PDF), with schedules |
| **Trial & Value Tracker** | Steering group | 90-day MDVM trial countdown, 4-phase PoV plan with tasks you can tick off, success criteria (baseline vs today vs target), prerequisites |

Other things to try: the **company selector** (scopes every view), the **persona switcher** (CISO / Analyst / BU IT Lead each land on their own view), **Ctrl + K** search, and the light/dark toggle.

## How the mock works

```
backend/
  server.js                 Express API (all endpoints)
  src/data/companies.js     Group companies, tool coverage, maturity, SLA policy  ← edit to change the story
  src/data/catalog.js       ~45 real CVEs / config weaknesses, with which tool detects each one
  src/data/generator.js     Seeded generator: assets, per-tool detections, correlation, remediation history
  src/analytics.js          KPIs, trends, scorecards, reconciliation, SLA; everything derived from findings
  src/insights.js           Simulated GenAI: briefings, copilot intents, reports, integrations, PoV tracker
frontend/src/
  App.jsx, nav.js           Shell, routing (hash), personas
  pages/*.jsx               One file per screen
  components/charts.jsx     Hand-built SVG charts (line, stacked columns, donut, gauge, Venn, Sankey)
```

- **Correlation:** each asset may be covered by Defender, Rapid7, both or neither. A weakness produces one *unified finding* per (asset, CVE), carrying every source that detected it. Raw rows minus unified findings = duplicates removed.
- **Unified risk score (0–100):** CVSS × 5 (50) + KEV / exploit maturity (20) + EPSS (8) + business criticality from CMDB (15) + internet-facing (10). It maps to the SHV SLA: P1 ≥ 85 → 7 days, P2 ≥ 70 → 30 days, P3 ≥ 50 → 60 days, P4 → 90 days.
- **MTTI:** Defender detects within ~1 day (agent); Rapid7 detects on its scan cadence (7–30 days per company). Unified MTTI takes the earliest signal from either tool.
- **State:** tickets, PoV task ticks and connector syncs live in memory and reset when the backend restarts.

## Main API endpoints

`GET /api/overview?company=` · `GET /api/vulnerabilities` · `GET /api/vulnerabilities/:cve` · `GET /api/assets` · `GET /api/assets/:id` · `GET /api/reconciliation` · `GET /api/remediation` · `POST /api/copilot` · `POST /api/tickets` · `GET /api/integrations` · `POST /api/integrations/:id/sync` · `GET /api/pov` · `GET /api/reports/:type` (weekly | monthly | audit) · `GET /api/search?q=`

## Path to production (for the discussion)

1. Replace `generator.js` with connectors: Defender XDR API / Advanced Hunting (`DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities`, `DeviceInfo`), Rapid7 InsightVM API v3, ServiceNow CMDB Table API, CISA KEV + FIRST EPSS feeds.
2. Persist to a store (e.g. Fabric Lakehouse / Azure SQL) and publish the same model to Power BI.
3. Swap `insights.js` templates for Azure OpenAI prompts grounded on the computed metrics (EU data boundary; no raw host data in prompts).
